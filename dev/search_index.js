Broadly speaking, it is a method for detecting shifts in the process of diversification that led to the biodiversity present today. In order to study diversification, we are interested in two events: speciation and extinction events.  Since these events are difficult to observe, we use a simple model, the birth-death process, to model what happened in the past.  On this page, there is some background material that introduces the mathematical models that we use.","category":"page"},{"location":"#The-birth-death-model","page":"Home","title":"The birth-death model","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Under the standard birth-death model, the tempo at which species speciate and go extinct are controlled by two parameters (Nee et al. 1994):","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The speciation rate (lambda)\nThe extinction rate (mu)","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"In its simplest model, the rates of the birth-death process are the same across different lineages in the tree, and across time.
